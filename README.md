# Java
Exercises of Parallel and Distributed Programming in Java.

# Lab2
Given below is a sequential program that calculates the frequency of even values in a large array. Your task is to write a parallel solution that distributes all of the workload over the number of processors on the machine executing your program. The work should be distributed so that each thread deals with block segments that do not differ in size by more than 1.

```
 public static void main(String[] args) {
          int f[] = new int[1000000];
          for(int j = 0; j < f.length;j++) f[j] = (int)(Math.random()*100000);
          int freq = 0;
          for(int j = 0; j < f.length; j++)
        	  if(f[j] % 2 == 0) freq++;
          System.out.println(freq);
      }
 ```
 # Lab 3
 A program is required to find the largest value together with the frequency of its occurrence in a huge integer array. This program will be executed on a multi-core machine and the program must maximize the use of this resource. Using a Threadpool and the Callable interface and the examples outlined in the lectures write a solution to this problem. You can also use ForkJoinPool.
 
 # Lab5
Given is a class Point that is not thread safe. Your task is to write a class, called CollectionPoint (The outline has been given to you), that manages a collection of Point instances. This class owns the points under its control and must synchronize concurrent activity. Hence, the class must also be thread safe. The class CollectionPoint should use an ArrayList to store points and must provide the following interface methods: add, that adds a new point to the collection; search, that searches for a point in the class and returns true or false; getAllX(int x) that returns a list of all points whose x-ordinate matches x; toString, that the list of points as a String. It should also be possible to replace an existing point with a new one. The class Point is immutable and, hence, does not require synchronization.


# Lab6
In the Prado museum in Madrid there is a small seating area where visitors can view Picassoâ€™s Guernica. 
Each visitor must find a seat and may view the painting for as long as they choose. 
Your task is to write a class called ViewingStand that manages access to the seats. 
The class has two methods: findSeat and leaveSeat. 
Seats may not be shared by visitors, i.e. two visitors cannot share the same seat. 
In the event that a seat is not available a visitor simply continues to check for one. 
There is no wait for a seat to become vacant. 
It is important to optimize the search for a seat so that multiple visitors can concurrently search for seats. 
Write a simple simulator for your class that uses threads to model visitors. 
Use ReentrantLock with Condition to implement.
